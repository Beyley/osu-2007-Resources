# osu! Webserver Protocol

None of this has been found out by me, Im hardly the first that has created a 2007 server
others include iceblade112 (This is where i got most of my information) and ilyt, which made a
NodeJS Port of this, though the NodeJS code is fairly unstable, it can hang at times and the only way to go back
is to restart the entire server, osu! 2007 is really the simplest server you can build, doesnt take too much time
and is not very complicated.
